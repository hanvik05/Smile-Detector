# Smile Detector
 The Smile Detector is a project aimed at automatically detecting whether a person is smiling or not. 
 This code uses the xml files from harcascade.
 <br />
 This is a Computer Vision project. 
 <br />
 <br />
This project uses face detection techniques to identify the different parts on the image.
This project on execution opens up a pop up video, which activates the laptop camera. In case you are using a external webcam change the following code 
<br />
video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
<br />
to 
<br />
video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
<br />
During the face detection the code breaks the image into several small parts and searches for important features (eyes, nose etc.â€¦) in case of finding a face. The features for eye detection are eye balls, eye lashes. For the smile the code searches for lips, teeth as the features.

##  Code Output

A pop up window opens.
